              It began on a dreary September day that I was born. It was the
              beginning of the world's greatest protagoni- oh my bad I meant
              PROCRASTINATOR. <br />
              As a Web/Interactive Media my speciality lies in making websites
              and making them look nice. (The only way to explain my major to my
              family that they understand...seriously). Even though in the end,
              I am simply telling something with the intelligence of a rock what
              to do. <br />
              I happen to have been born with colorblindness and ADHD, two
              things that can make my daily life and education in design
              difficult. Though, ADHD can actually be helpful with how it has
              changed how my brain functions. I process things quickly, and
              learn things even faster. I am a Jack of all Trades, and yet a
              master of none. <br / > Coding wasn't something I expected to
              enjoy so much but it made sense. I come from a family of artists
              with my mom being a graphite artist and my sister a photography.
              They can always make some amazing visual art but I never
              could...but I could write. Learning to write code and seeing what
              I write become something visually is the most amazing feeling in
              the world. As a writer, code was just another way to write, and
              front end work ended up feeling natural. <br />
              Oh, I also like gaming, writing, anime, manga, learning new
              things, and I am an expert on random facts that aren't helpful but
              make you scratch your head and go "Really? Huh I never would've
              thought that".
